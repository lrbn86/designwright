        <h1>About DesignWright</h1>
        <p>
          DesignWright was established in August 2021 to pursue the mission of solving design problems. 
          DesignWright specializes in designing and developing custom web applications that improve the space of project management. 
          Project managers are integral to the success of a business's project endeavors. A project is only successful with proper management.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project managers use a variety of tools to help them manage projects. 
          However, most of these tools are built to satisfy the general needs of a simple project. 
          If the projects were complex, these tools would need to provide extensions or extra features to solve specific problems. 
          Project managers will need to learn any newly added extensions or features to be able to manage a project efficiently. They may also need to pay extra for these new extensions and features.
          This can be a huge waste of time and money!
        </p>
        <p>
          Through a consultation with DesignWright, project managers can specify exactly what they need in order to manage a project better while saving time and reducing cost.
