            <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
            <p>We believe in having the user at the center of design. This allows us to provide an enjoyable experience for both you and your clients.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>User Research - We will help you learn more about your current and prospective clients</li>
              <li>Prototyping - We learn fast by failing fast. Prototypes help to ensure that your design problems are actually being solved.</li>
              <li>Evaluation - There is no perfect solution to a design problem. However, we will continuously evaluate our design solutions to ensure that your business will meet its goals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Product Lifecycle Management &amp; Product Data Management</h2>
            <p>No product exists forever. Every moment in time, there will always be new ideas. However, these new ideas often do not become real products due to lack of proper product lifecycle and data management. By entrusting your ideas to us, we can help you realize a tangible product by using software tools such as simulations and computer-aided design (CAD).</p>

          <div class="service">
            <h2>Web Design &amp; Development</h2>
            <p>Successful businesses have established online presence. A common way to establish an online presence would be to have a website. A website is like the office building of your business in a virtual world. A website can provide information to your current clients or convert prospective clients to your business.</p>
