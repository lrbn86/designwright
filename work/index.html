        <h4>Covid-19 - Producing Education Results</h4>
        <p>Switching to online has been hard on a lot on industries. Communication has been limited to emailing and zoom calls. Elementary level teachers are struggling to give a proper education through virtual tools which is where we come in.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>We want to help our teachers navigate this new world of interacting with children with low technicological abilities see gaps in their own educations.</p>
        <p>We understand that teachers thrive off of student feedback in an in-person classroom and we worked to provide this in a zoom platform.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>We work directly with our users to make sure we create our tools with the users’ needs and abilities in mind. This creates a solution that actually solves the lack of feedback over blank screens. We improve different touchpoints throughout the entire user journey to increase the understanding if students are actually learning the material and participating in class.</p>
