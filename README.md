## Master branch

There are three folders that represents a page: about, team, and work. Each folder has a index.html that corresponds to that page. The reason for structuring this way instead of directly linking to about.html, team.html, and work.html is because the URL will not have .html extension if the user goes to the link (e.g. https://www.designwright.dev/about/ instead of https://www.designwright.dev/about.html)
